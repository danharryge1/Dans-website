# DanGeorge.studio — Project Log

Live state of the build. Updated after every completed task so [[Dans Website/claude]] sessions can resume cleanly after compaction.

> [!info] Where to look for what
> - Design of record → [[2026-04-17-layout-shell-design]]
> - Implementation plan → [[2026-04-17-layout-shell]]
> - Visual system → [[design]]
> - Brand / voice → [[PRD]]
> - Project conventions → [[claude]]

## Current status

> [!info] Services section in progress — 2026-04-18
> Tasks 0–6 complete. Desktop scrub reveal + mobile one-shot reveal (IO-gated, leak-tight) both wired. 61/61 tests green. Next: Task 7 (3D hover tilt via Motion — TDD; converts ServiceCard to `'use client'`).

> [!success] Hero section complete — 2026-04-18
> All 13 tasks shipped. Prod Lighthouse: Perf 97 / A11y 100 / BP 100. Seam runway pinned at `+=100%`, reduced-motion parity fixed (sparkles + side-labels now resolve), img intrinsic dims set. Next phase: **Services section** (design.md §2.3) — kicks off with `/brainstorming` for the Services spec.

> [!success] Layout shell complete — 2026-04-17
> Nav + Footer + Container wired, tokenised, WCAG-AA, keyboard-accessible, font-preloaded.

> [!note] Tooling added 2026-04-17
> `playwright-cli` (Microsoft) installed globally + mirrored to `~/.claude/skills/playwright-cli/`. Source cloned into `Anti gravity Skills/Advanced_and_Agents/playwright-cli/`. Used for Task 8 breakpoint verification — drives a real Chrome at 1920/768/375, programmatic scroll, snapshot-based click refs. Screenshots committed at `docs/verification/2026-04-17-layout-shell/`.

## Workflow chain

`brainstorming → writing-plans → subagent-driven-development → TDD build (taste-skill · impeccable · typeset · layout · stitch-skill) → verification-before-completion → audit → polish`.

## Task progress — Services Section

Mirror of the plan's checkboxes. Source of truth is still [2026-04-18-services-section](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-18-services-section.md).

- [x] **Task 0** — Services design tokens + arc-float keyframes + reduced-motion guards in `globals.css` (commit `0cd9893`)
- [x] **Task 1** — Build `services.data.ts` — three service entries (commit `0cd9893`)
- [x] **Task 2** — Build `ServiceCard` (TDD) — arc flourish + sweep overlay + label (commit `0cd9893`)
- [x] **Task 3** — Build `Services` server component + heading + 3-card grid (TDD, 4/4 tests) (commit `124b386` + refactor `8ece611` — dropped unneeded React cast + wrapper div; `className` now flows to ServiceCard root)
- [x] **Task 4** — Wire `<Services />` into `page.tsx` + flip `--sweep-x` default to lit (commit `a16ecd1`, build: 55/55 tests, prod build green)
- [x] **Task 5** — Desktop scroll-linked reveal in `ServicesClient` (TDD, 3/3 ServicesClient tests, 58/58 total) (commits `b2f1b6e` + `5d36e5d` — dropped unused scopeRef + dead sr-only div)
- [x] **Task 6** — Mobile one-shot reveal branch (TDD, 6/6 ServicesClient tests, 61/61 total) (commits `d19e641` + `b165bcb` — killed infinite arc-float tween leak; tightened `repeat:-1` coverage)
- [ ] **Task 7** — 3D hover tilt via Motion (TDD)
- [ ] **Task 8** — Browser verification via playwright-cli
- [ ] **Task 9** — `audit` + `polish` passes

## Task progress — Hero Section

Mirror of the plan's checkboxes. Source of truth is still [2026-04-17-hero-section](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-17-hero-section.md).

- [x] **Task 0** — Hero design tokens + sparkle keyframes in `globals.css` (commit `cb82a68`)
- [x] **Task 1** — Transcode NextUp "Draft" asset into `public/assets/hero/nextup-old.webp` (commit `ee95d00`)
- [x] **Task 2** — Build `PerspectiveGrid` (TDD) (commit `ec8ff09`)
- [x] **Task 3** — Build `HeroSparkles` (TDD) (commit `8df2fb1`)
- [x] **Task 4** — Build `HeroScrollHint` (TDD) (commit `7ad5fa3`)
- [x] **Task 5** — Build `HeroLaptop` (TDD) (commit `c05b93f`)
- [x] **Task 6** — Build `HeroScreen` (TDD) (commit `861f2ba`)
- [x] **Task 7** — Build `Hero` Server Component + stub `HeroClient` (TDD, 26/26 tests) (commit `575a51b`)
- [x] **Task 8** — Wire `<Hero />` into `page.tsx` + visual check static state (commit `5e51eef`)
- [x] **Task 9** — Implement `HeroClient` — GSAP + Lenis + ScrollTrigger lifecycle (TDD, 6/6 tests, 45/45 total) (commits `cefe9ea` + fix `85b583e` — mobile IO leak plug + `CSSVarTweenVars` type helper + strengthened reduced-motion/IO tests)
- [x] **Task 10** — Capture nextupco.com live hero + transcode (commits `75292f7` + fix `8c612d7` — 4s loop, CRF 30/38, combined 1.24 MB, settled poster at t=2.5s)
- [x] **Task 11** — Browser verification via playwright-cli (commit `91e62be` — 10 screenshots + Lighthouse + NOTES.md at `docs/verification/2026-04-18-hero/`. Findings for Task 12: seam scrub truncates because hero-only page has ~80px of runway vs 100vh expected — needs `pin: true` + `end: "+=100%"`; Lighthouse dev-build Perf 69 to re-measure on `next build`; A11y/BP both 100)
- [x] **Task 12** — `audit` + `polish` passes (commits `72009cf` runway fix · `d2382e9` reduced-motion parity + img intrinsic dims · `36c105c` prod Lighthouse + polished screenshots). Polish pass skipped: requested gold-accent seam already implemented in `HeroScreen.tsx`. Prod Lighthouse Perf 97 / A11y 100 / BP 100.

## Task progress — Layout Shell

Mirror of the plan's checkboxes. Source of truth is still [[2026-04-17-layout-shell]] — this is a glanceable summary.

- [x] **Task 9** — `audit` + `polish` passes (commit `7b350c2`) — a11y (Esc/focus-trap/focus-return/44×44), `--nav-scrolled-bg` tokenised, `--text-secondary` bumped to WCAG AA, reduced-motion, font preload, 3 post-polish screenshots

## Locked-in decisions (layout shell)

> [!success] Approved 2026-04-17
> - Mobile nav → full-screen overlay (`#0B2422`, Comico 48px stacked, × to close)
> - Nav scroll behaviour → transparent until `scrollY > 100`, then backdrop-blur + `rgba(11,36,34,0.6)` fades in over 250ms
> - Container → `max-w-[1400px]`, gutters `px-6 md:px-10 lg:px-12`
> - Footer copy → `© {year} DanGeorge.studio. Every pixel considered.` (dynamic year)
> - Nav positioning → fixed
