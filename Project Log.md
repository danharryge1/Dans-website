# DanGeorge.studio — Project Log

Live state of the build. Updated after every completed task so [[Dans Website/claude]] sessions can resume cleanly after compaction.

> [!info] Where to look for what
> - Design of record → [[2026-04-17-layout-shell-design]]
> - Implementation plan → [[2026-04-17-layout-shell]]
> - Visual system → [[design]]
> - Brand / voice → [[PRD]]
> - Project conventions → [[claude]]

## Current status

> [!info] Hero section in progress — 2026-04-18
> Tasks 0–11 complete. Next concrete action: **Task 12** — audit + polish passes. Top finding to address: seam scrub runway (pin the hero or add page runway so scrub range = one viewport).

> [!success] Layout shell complete — 2026-04-17
> Nav + Footer + Container wired, tokenised, WCAG-AA, keyboard-accessible, font-preloaded.

> [!note] Tooling added 2026-04-17
> `playwright-cli` (Microsoft) installed globally + mirrored to `~/.claude/skills/playwright-cli/`. Source cloned into `Anti gravity Skills/Advanced_and_Agents/playwright-cli/`. Used for Task 8 breakpoint verification — drives a real Chrome at 1920/768/375, programmatic scroll, snapshot-based click refs. Screenshots committed at `docs/verification/2026-04-17-layout-shell/`.

## Workflow chain

`brainstorming → writing-plans → subagent-driven-development → TDD build (taste-skill · impeccable · typeset · layout · stitch-skill) → verification-before-completion → audit → polish`.

## Task progress — Hero Section

Mirror of the plan's checkboxes. Source of truth is still [2026-04-17-hero-section](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-17-hero-section.md).

- [x] **Task 0** — Hero design tokens + sparkle keyframes in `globals.css` (commit `cb82a68`)
- [x] **Task 1** — Transcode NextUp "Draft" asset into `public/assets/hero/nextup-old.webp` (commit `ee95d00`)
- [x] **Task 2** — Build `PerspectiveGrid` (TDD) (commit `ec8ff09`)
- [x] **Task 3** — Build `HeroSparkles` (TDD) (commit `8df2fb1`)
- [x] **Task 4** — Build `HeroScrollHint` (TDD) (commit `7ad5fa3`)
- [x] **Task 5** — Build `HeroLaptop` (TDD) (commit `c05b93f`)
- [x] **Task 6** — Build `HeroScreen` (TDD) (commit `861f2ba`)
- [x] **Task 7** — Build `Hero` Server Component + stub `HeroClient` (TDD, 26/26 tests) (commit `575a51b`)
- [x] **Task 8** — Wire `<Hero />` into `page.tsx` + visual check static state (commit `5e51eef`)
- [x] **Task 9** — Implement `HeroClient` — GSAP + Lenis + ScrollTrigger lifecycle (TDD, 6/6 tests, 45/45 total) (commits `cefe9ea` + fix `85b583e` — mobile IO leak plug + `CSSVarTweenVars` type helper + strengthened reduced-motion/IO tests)
- [x] **Task 10** — Capture nextupco.com live hero + transcode (commits `75292f7` + fix `8c612d7` — 4s loop, CRF 30/38, combined 1.24 MB, settled poster at t=2.5s)
- [x] **Task 11** — Browser verification via playwright-cli (commit `91e62be` — 10 screenshots + Lighthouse + NOTES.md at `docs/verification/2026-04-18-hero/`. Findings for Task 12: seam scrub truncates because hero-only page has ~80px of runway vs 100vh expected — needs `pin: true` + `end: "+=100%"`; Lighthouse dev-build Perf 69 to re-measure on `next build`; A11y/BP both 100)
- [ ] **Task 12** — `audit` + `polish` passes

## Task progress — Layout Shell

Mirror of the plan's checkboxes. Source of truth is still [[2026-04-17-layout-shell]] — this is a glanceable summary.

- [x] **Task 0** — Vitest + RTL test infrastructure (commit `7c4ee61`)
- [x] **Task 1** — Install gsap / lenis / motion / three (commit `0dfc71d`)
- [x] **Task 2** — Copy fonts to `public/fonts/` (commit `68e68ae`)
- [x] **Task 3** — Rewrite `globals.css` (tokens + `@font-face` + Tailwind theme) (commit `357c837`)
- [x] **Task 4** — Build `Container` component (TDD) (commit `a2baa20`)
- [x] **Task 5** — Build `Footer` component (TDD) (commit `deba0e4`)
- [x] **Task 6** — Build `Nav` component (TDD, client, scroll + mobile overlay) (commit `edd6471`)
- [x] **Task 7** — Wire layout.tsx + page.tsx (commit `d342e7b`)
- [x] **Task 8** — Browser verification via playwright-cli + `verification-before-completion` (5 screenshots, 13/13 tests, tsc/lint/build clean)
- [x] **Task 9** — `audit` + `polish` passes (commit `7b350c2`) — a11y (Esc/focus-trap/focus-return/44×44), `--nav-scrolled-bg` tokenised, `--text-secondary` bumped to WCAG AA, reduced-motion, font preload, 3 post-polish screenshots

## Locked-in decisions (layout shell)

> [!success] Approved 2026-04-17
> - Mobile nav → full-screen overlay (`#0B2422`, Comico 48px stacked, × to close)
> - Nav scroll behaviour → transparent until `scrollY > 100`, then backdrop-blur + `rgba(11,36,34,0.6)` fades in over 250ms
> - Container → `max-w-[1400px]`, gutters `px-6 md:px-10 lg:px-12`
> - Footer copy → `© {year} DanGeorge.studio. Every pixel considered.` (dynamic year)
> - Nav positioning → fixed

## Git state

- Local repo initialised on `main` at `~/The Vault/Dans Website/`
- Remote `origin` → `https://github.com/danharryge1/Dans-website.git`
- Initial commit `d1d3be7` pushed 2026-04-17 (scaffold + spec + plan)
- Author auto-configured as `Dan George <dangeorge@Dans-MacBook-Air.local>` — may want to change to `danharryge1@gmail.com` via repo-local `git config`
- Strategy: per-task commits pushed to `origin main` after each successful review

## Skills installed globally

At `~/.claude/skills/`:
- `superpowers` — brainstorming, writing-plans, subagent-driven-development, TDD, verification, audit
- `impeccable` — shape, polish, typeset, layout, audit, critique, distill, delight, harden, optimize, overdrive, bolder, quieter, clarify, colorize, adapt
- `taste-skill` — taste, soft, stitch, minimalist, brutalist, redesign, output
- `webgpu-threejs-tsl` — (deferred, not in use this phase)
- `obsidian-markdown` — installed 2026-04-17 to maintain this log

## Next phase after layout shell

Hero section — perspective grid background, Comico headline, CTA. Separate spec + plan. Will likely want `overdrive` + `animate` + possibly `webgpu-threejs-tsl`.
